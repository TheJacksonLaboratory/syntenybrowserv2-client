                The feature search allows users to search for genome features
                such as QTLs and individual (or groups of) genes.
                <br/>
                Searches could be done either by <b>attributes</b> such as feature
                symbol or type, or by <b>ontology term association</b>. Users can
                toggle between the two search options using the select above the
                visible table without having their selections cleared. To learn more
                about the source of the data resulting in the table read the Data
                Sources &amp; Formats page.
                <br/>
                The feature search will always search and display results for
                the selected reference species, which can be changed from the
                select options. By default, the reference genome is the mouse
                and the comparison is the human.
                <br/>
                The search feature table can be filtered to narrow the results
                and the selected features will appear in the area below. From the
                search results, users can select some or all of the data elements
                for viewing in the genome view.

                The genome view consists of two rings: the outer ring represents the
                selected reference genome, separated into chromosomes and the inner
                ring represents the comparison genome, also separated into chromosomes.
                <br/>
                Users can alternatively skip the feature search and begin
                their exploration of conserved synteny by selecting one of the
                reference chromosomes displayed in the outer ring in the genome view.
                This action will generate color arcs showing
                the regions of conserved synteny in the comparison genome.
                <br/>
                Selected data elements resulting from a feature search are indicated by
                labels along the reference genome; the syntenic blocks of the selected
                data elements are also extended out from the inner edge of the reference
                chromosome for emphasis. If you click on a reference chromosome that contains
                features you selected from the feature/ontology search, the regions that
                contain at least one feature will extend to the locations in the comparison
                genome.

                The syntenic block view browser displays the genome features
                in the reference and comparison species. This consists of
                five distinct elements (top to bottom): a set of tools, the linear genome view,
                a chromosome view, the reference and comparison tracks, and a comparison genome key.
                The reference genome track is shaded in gray and the comparison
                genome is color coded to highlight the chromosomal locations of
                the conserved syntenic blocks.
                <br/>
                Navigation operations in block view include zoom and pan. Guidelines
                to indicate the anchor features used to define blocks can be toggled on and off.

                A unique function of the JAX Synteny Browser lies in the syntenic
                block feature display filters. The filter interface allows researchers
                to search for and selectively display genome features within the
                region of conserved synteny that match biological attributes of interest.
                <br/>
                The block view browser contains a lot of information and much of it may
                not be pertinent to what youâ€™re looking for. You have the ability to select
                features from the feature table towards the top of the application,
                which will appear in red in the block view, but filtering can add another
                level of focus to features or regions of interest.
                <br/>
                The filtering can be limited to the reference
                or comparison genomes, or set to include matches from either genome.
                A table of matching features is displayed in the 'Preview Filters'
                section of the filtering tool and can be downloaded as
                a comma separated file. The locations of matching features are highlighted
                in the block view using vertical tick marks.
